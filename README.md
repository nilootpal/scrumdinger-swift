# Scrumdinger-Swift

### First part(https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/using-stacks-to-arrange-views)

First replace the existing body with Progress View. 

##Stacks

Firstly, let us use STACKS to create a view of the main page of Scrumdinger

Stacks : 
1. HStack
2. VStack
3. ZStack

We can add alignment to the stack.

To refactor a piece of Code we use Control+Click.

##Images

The image uses one of the included SF Symbols. We can get more system symbols from SF Symbol App


To customize a SwiftUI view, you call methods known as modifiers. Each modifier returns a new view. You can use multiple modifiers on a single view. To chain modifiers, stack them vertically.

##Accessibility

SwiftUI has built-in accessibility, so you get accessibility support with little additional work. But sometimes, you might want to supplement the inferred data to enhance the accessibility experience for your users.

### Second part(https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/creating-a-card-view)

We use enumeration of type String which converts each case to a string.

Named colors in the asset catalog must match their references in code, so make sure to spell each case correctly.

We create a DailyScrum structure

We also create a customised Label Style to play with the given views
